Hi! I'm Katie. 

I am an undergradute in my senior year in the Geography department here. I have really enjoyed all of the courses I have taken through the department but I am still unsure of what I would like to pursue as a career. I'm kind of okay with that though, there are lots of oppertunities so I don't have to decide right now. Right now, I'm leaning in the direction of somehow working refugees but who know what the future will bring.  

Currently, I am a bartender at the Casual Pint Downtown. It's a really laid back job, that allows me to talk to people of all different sorts. Plus, I get to try new craft beers every time I go to work, which is pretty cool.
